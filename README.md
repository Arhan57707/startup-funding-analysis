# Startup Funding and Investor Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes startup funding data to identify key trends, top industries, and active investors over time. It combines SQL for data querying, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, and Excel for reporting. 

## Dataset
The dataset contains startup funding rounds with columns like date, startup name, industry, investor names, investment type, and funding amount in USD. Publicly available or Kaggle data is used.

## Objectives
- Query and aggregate large datasets using SQL.
- Clean and merge datasets using Pandas.
- Perform statistical analysis with NumPy.
- Visualize funding trends, top investors, and industries using Matplotlib.
- Export summary reports to Excel.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Setup Python environment:
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to reproduce analysis.
4. SQL queries are stored in `/sql` (coming soon).
